This course consists of six review questions, two lab assignments, and one final project. All the assignments should be done in groups of two and have to be submitted before their deadlines. 
All the assignments are graded. The review questions are graded A-F. The two lab assignments have A, C, and E grading. To deliver the labs, students should submit the source codes before the deadlines and 
give an oral presentation about their implementations. They also need to answer questions that include basic and advanced questions. Suppose students implement the labs and answer all the questions. 
In that case, they will get A. If they can only answer the basic questions, they will get C, and if they cannot answer the questions, they will get E. The final project has A-D grading. Students should 
propose a topic to implement as the final project. Based on the complexity of the proposal, it will be an A-level proposal or a C-level proposal. This assignment also includes an oral presentation. 
If students implement the proposed topic and answer the questions in the oral exam, they will get either A or C, based on the difficulty level of the topic. If they only do the implementation, but cannot 
answer the questions, the grades would be B or D, respectively.

### The Final Grade
The final grade is the average of the two labs, the project, and the review questions. To compute the final grade, you can map A-F to 5-1, and take the average. The floating values are rounded up if they are more than half, otherwise they are rounded down. For example, 3.6 will be rounded to 4, and 4.2 will be rounded to 4.

# Review Questions
For each review question, you are asked to answer a few questions about each lecture.
* **RQ1**: linear regression and classification [[pdf](/assignments/rq1.pdf)]

# Lab Assignments
The lab assignments span over different topics of the course. For each lab, a zip file is given that includes instructions for doing the assignment.

# Project
You should define your own project by writing at most one page description of the project. The proposed project should be approved by the examiner. The project proposal should cover the following headings:
* **Problem description:** what is the problem that you will be investigating?
* **Tools:** what tools you are going to use? In the course we mainly used Spark and Tensorflow, but you are free to explore new tools and technologies.
* **Data:** what data will you use and how are you going to collect it? 
* **Methodology and algorithm:** what method(s) or algorithm(s) are you proposing? 

### What to deliver
You can implement your code using Jupyter Notebook or as a stand alone application. You should submit a zip file containing your code and a short report (two to three pages) about what you have done, the dataset, your method, your results, and how to run the code.
