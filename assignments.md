This course consists of six review questions, one reading assignment, two lab assignments, one final project, and the final exam. All the assignments should be done in groups of two and have to be submitted before their deadlines. The review questions and the reading assignment are Pass/Fail assignments, 
and the labs and the project are graded from A to F. To pass the course, you should pass all the review and the reading assignments, and get at least E in all the other assignments and the final exam.

### The Final Grade
The final grade is the average of the two labs, the project, and the final exam. To compute the final grade, you can map A-F to 5-1, and take the average. The floating values are rounded up if they are more than half, otherwise they are rounded down. For example, 3.6 will be rounded to 4, and 4.2 will be rounded to 4.

# Lab Assignments
The lab assignments span over different topics of the course. For each lab, a zip file is given that includes instructions for doing the assignment.

* **Programming environment:** we will use the Jupyter Notebook in the lab assignments. Here, you can find the required information to setup the programming environment [[pdf](/slides/labs_env.pdf)]
* **Lab 1:** In this lab assignment you will practice the basics of regression and classification in Spark. The given notebook is in Scala, but you feel free to use Python if you prefer. You can download the assignment from [[here](/assignments/lab1.zip)].
* **Lab 2:** TBA

# Reading Assignments
For the reading assignment, you are asked to choose a paper form the list of given papers (or propose a paper youself that should be approved by the instructures), and write a **two-page** review. The reviews should have the following sections:
* **Motivation:** describe the motivation of the paper, and explain WHY the addressed problem is interesting and important to be solved.
* **Contributions:** explain the main contributions of the paper, and present WHAT the solved problems are.
* **Solution:** very briefly explain HOW the authors solve the mentioned problems.
* **Strong and weak points:** What are the strong and weak points of the paper?

# Project
You should define your own project by writing at most one page description of the project. The proposed project should be approved by the examiner. The project proposal should cover the following headings:
* **Problem description:** what is the problem that you will be investigating?
* **Tools:** what tools you are going to use? In the course we mainly used Spark and Tensorflow, but you are free to explore new tools and technologies.
* **Data:** what data will you use and how are you going to collect it? 
* **Methodology and algorithm:** what method(s) or algorithm(s) are you proposing? 

### What to deliver
You can implement your code using Jupyter Notebook or as a stand alone application. You should submit a zip file containing your code and a short report (two to three pages) about what you have done, the dataset, your method, your results, and how to run the code.
