This course consists of five review questions, two lab assignments, and one final project. All the assignments should be done in groups of two and have to be submitted before their deadlines. 
All the assignments are graded A-F, and students should submit them before the deadlines. A late submission will reduce the assignment’s grade level by one. That is, A will become B, B will become C, 
and so on. To deliver the labs and the final project, in addition to the source code, students should give an oral presentation of their code and answer questions that include basic and advanced questions. 
The details of the grading are presented in the slides of the introduction lecture.

# Review Questions

# Project
You should define your own project by writing at most one page description of the project. The proposed project should be approved by the examiner. The project proposal should cover the following headings:
* **Problem description:** what is the problem that you will be investigating?
* **Tools:** what tools you are going to use? In the course we mainly used Spark and Tensorflow, but you are free to explore new tools and technologies.
* **Data:** what data will you use and how are you going to collect it? 
* **Methodology and algorithm:** what method(s) or algorithm(s) are you proposing? 

### What to deliver
You can implement your code using Jupyter Notebook or as a stand alone application. You should submit a zip file containing your code and a short report (two to three pages) about what you have done, the dataset, your method, your results, and how to run the code.
